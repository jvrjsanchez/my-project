# my-project

## Introduction

**I am developing a new way to see code done by the open source community**

// But first let me lay out the details that uniquely describe what this project is all about 

 */Hello*/
// The inception of this project came to be special since it brings forth challenges along with advanced learning and ops! 

# Description

## Purpose
// To change the game of open source commonalities and specificities to impact the software tech industry. 
## Goals
// Transform the software into a reliable AI that simplifies life.
## Target audience
// Tech investors and entreprenurial affiliates in the business school and Columbia Alumini Center
## Relevant background information
// The JTC program had a lot to do with the inception of this project. 

**Uniqueness through Code
// Just like car services, things break down in the open source community. So what if there was a shop or mega service that would help with that. AI only shows best recommendations, but I'm leaning more towards developing a service that learns and delivers through best practices.

## Resources 
// The state of the art machine learning models that transcend into adaptability behavior. 
// Investments and hedge fund managers who can drive a project into the hands of important CEOs.
// Lots of Javascript (front-end), Python (back-end), CUDA programming (GPU performance) and many more frameworks.
// {hyperlinks to documentation, libraries, etc.}
## Getting Started 
// Installation steps are below:
*/ Jupyterlab, conda-forge, ...*/
*/ docker-compose, django, ...*/

## Warnings
// Slow run times due to GPU performances. Updates, updates, and more debbuging.
// Testing constantly challenging data, and posting on stackoverflow for help!

## Testing for Jargon
// To change the game of open matter interests and full force the close business. Shift the noise into a sure way of life. Big seats and high wave band in the business school. The plan had a lot to do with the head of this matter.
